#### Data description:
The following are the features that can be found in the dataset of physicians in the US as well as the values they can take. This features will be generated later on respecting real life statistics in order to mimic real life cases. There exists correlation between the mentioned attributes, this correlation has to be implemented while generation data in order to guarantee the veracity of the output data.


#### Age: 4 age groups
As of 2018, the largest distribution of U.S. physicians was between the ages of 55 and 65 years old. At that time about 29 percent of physicians fell within this age group. With just 11.2 percent of all physicians, the smallest distribution of U.S. physicians was among those aged 35 years or younger.

 - 11.2% of population is age range from 25-35
 - 19.8% of population is age range from 36-45
 - 22.9% of population is age range 46-55
 - 29% of population is age range 56-65
 - 17% of population is age range 66-75

4) States:  (54 possible values)


5) Gender 
Professionally Active Physicians by Gender
Gender distribution by speciality


6)   Working place: (8 possible values)
Describing the nature of their workplace which could be a hospital, a clinic, etc..

7)  Physicians compensation:
by speciality :
Orthopedics and Cardiology have been among the top-earning specialties
in the survey every year for the past 5 years.Pediatrics, family medicine, and diabetes and endocrinology have been among the lowest.



By gender:


BY race:
Caucasian/white physicians earn more than physicians of other races.



7)  Job performance satisfaction :
It an ordinal categorical variable that describes how the physician rates their satisfaction with their job on a scale 0-4.

8) Lifestyle & Happiness:
We have multiples measure with which we can calculate a lifestyle and happiness index.
E.g. Generation, specialty, health and wellness, vacation, work hours, marriage, exercice, etc..
This index would logically correlate with our target variable (burnout). You can find more details in the reference attached to this report.    







 
Study of burned out statistics observed in physicians, US.
During this study, we will go over the correlation of the features we have discussed in the previous section with our target feature: burnout. This is an important part as it define the generation of the burnout labels. 
E. g. if we notice that physicians in some specialities show more tendencies to burnout then weâ€™ll generate data that mirrors that but attributing the positive label for the burnout variable more to individuals in those specialties. 

In 2020, 42% of physicians reported that they burned out down from 46% 5 years ago.
